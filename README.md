#Generic DAO API

This is an API implementation of the Generic/Abstract DAO pattern.

You can use it with JPA/Hibernate and also MyBatis ORM. This will help you with applying the DRY principle which is usually violated at the DAO layer, with programmers writing the first DAO and the copy pasting code and just changing the class name.


The code is provided with example code as guidance on how to use it.
